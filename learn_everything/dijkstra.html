		<h1>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h1>

		<h2>How it Works</h2>
		<p>Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph from a starting node to all other
			nodes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Initialize distances to all nodes as infinity, except the starting node which is 0.</li>
			<li>Use a priority queue to keep track of nodes with the shortest distance.</li>
			<li>Pick the node with the smallest known distance and update its neighbors.</li>
			<li>Repeat until all nodes are visited.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Applications</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Route planning in GPS.</li>
			<li>Network routing protocols.</li>
			<li>Shortest path problems in robotics.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>
		<pre>
	  <code>
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
	distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
	distances[start] = 0
	queue = [(0, start)]

	while queue:
	current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)

	if current_distance &gt; distances[current_node]:
		continue

	for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
		distance = current_distance + weight

		if distance &lt; distances[neighbor]:
		distances[neighbor] = distance
		heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))

	return distances
	  </code>
