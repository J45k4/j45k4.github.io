    <h1>Newton's Laws of Motion</h1>

    <h2>First Law: Law of Inertia</h2>
    <p>An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>

    <h2>Second Law: F = ma</h2>
    <p>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.</p>

    <h2>Third Law: Action and Reaction</h2>
    <p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
