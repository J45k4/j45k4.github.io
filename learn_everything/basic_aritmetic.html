        <h1>Basic Arithmetic</h1>

        <h2>Addition</h2>
        <p>Addition is the process of combining numbers to find their total. The symbol for addition is '+'.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> 5 + 3 = 8</p>
        <p><strong>Real-world Example:</strong> If you have 5 apples and get 3 more, you'll have 8 apples.</p>

        <h2>Subtraction</h2>
        <p>Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another. The symbol for subtraction is '-'.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> 9 - 4 = 5</p>
        <p><strong>Real-world Example:</strong> If you have 9 candies and eat 4, you'll have 5 left.</p>

        <h2>Multiplication</h2>
        <p>Multiplication is the process of adding a number to itself a certain number of times. The symbol for
            multiplication is 'x' or '*'.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> 3 x 4 = 12</p>
        <p><strong>Real-world Example:</strong> If you have 3 boxes each containing 4 marbles, you'll have a total of 12
            marbles.</p>

        <h2>Division</h2>
        <p>Division is the process of splitting a number into equal parts. The symbol for division is '/' or 'รท'.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> 8 / 2 = 4</p>
        <p><strong>Real-world Example:</strong> If you have 8 cookies and share them equally with a friend, each of you
            will get 4 cookies.</p>
