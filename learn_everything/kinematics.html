        <h1>Kinematics</h1>

        <h2>Distance and Displacement</h2>
        <p>Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to "how much ground an object has covered" during its motion.
            Displacement is a vector quantity that refers to "how far out of place an object is"; it is the object's
            overall change in position.</p>

        <h2>Speed and Velocity</h2>
        <p>Speed is a scalar quantity that refers to "how fast an object is moving." Velocity is a vector quantity that
            refers to "the rate at which an object changes its position."</p>

        <h2>Acceleration</h2>
        <p>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time.</p>

        <h2>Equations of Motion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>\( s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \)</li>
            <li>\( v = u + at \)</li>
            <li>\( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \)</li>
        </ul>
